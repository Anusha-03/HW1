    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
        Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are <b>"singles"</b> (with one
        player per side) and <b>"doubles"</b>(with two players per side).
        Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a
        rectangular indoor court.
        Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of
        the court.
        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net.
        Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge,
        or (in their absence) the opposing side.
        The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the
        balls used in many other sports.
        In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly.
        Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports.
        The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.</p>
    <h2>History of Badminton</h2>
    <p> <img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_avif,q_glossy,ret_img,w_560/https://notbadminton.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/History-of-badminton.jpg"
            alt="History of Badminton" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px" ; width="500px" ; height="300px" ;>
        The game may have originally developed among expatriate officers in British India, where it was very popular by
        the 1870s.
        Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in
        Thanjavur as early as the 1850s and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the
        woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.
        Early on, the game was also known as <b>Poona</b> or <b>Poonah</b> after the garrison town of Poona,where it was particularly
        popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873.
        By 1875, officers returning home had started a badminton club in Folkestone.
        Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that
        <i>games between two or four competitors worked the best.</i>
        The shuttlecocks were coated with India rubber and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with lead.
        Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.</p>

    <h2>Equipments used in Badminton </h2>
    <h3> 1. Racquets</h3>
    <p> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Heads_of_badminton_raquets.jpg/255px-Heads_of_badminton_raquets.jpg"
            alt="Racquets" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px" ; width="200px" ; height="200px" ;>
        Badminton racquets are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between 70 and 95 grams (2.5 and 3.4
        ounces) not including grip or strings.
        They are composed of many different materials ranging from carbon fibre composite (graphite reinforced plastic)
        to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials.
        Carbon fibre has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent kinetic energy transfer.
        Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, racquets were made of light metals such as aluminium.
        Earlier still, racquets were made of wood.
        Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel, but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for
        the ordinary market, because of their excessive mass and cost.
        Nowadays, nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and fullerene are added to racquets giving them greater
        durability.</p>
    <h3> 2. Shuttlecock</h3>
    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg" alt="Shuttlecock"
            style="float: left; padding-right: 20px" ; width="150px" ; height="140px" ;>
        A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to shuttle; also called a birdie) is a high-drag projectile, with an open
        conical shape: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping feathers embedded into a rounded cork base.
        The cork is covered with thin leather or synthetic material.
        Synthetic shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break
        easily.
        These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base and a plastic skirt.</p>
